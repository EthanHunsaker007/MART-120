GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces,) and CLIs (Command Line interfaces) are two 
different avenues to achieve the same function. GUIs are interactable, visual 
representations of a program, i.e. a button or scrollbar. These interfaces are 
intuitive to use, but generally less efficient than the alternative, a CLI. 
Command line interfaces, such as the Linux terminal or Git Bash, receive user 
input through typed text commands. This system of input has a higher skill floor
than its alternative, but once all of the various commands and syntax have been
learned by the user CLI's generally allow for much more efficient completion of 
tasks.
