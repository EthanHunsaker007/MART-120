Learning styles are something I’ve personally already given quite a bit of 
thought, and I have to say, I agree with the article’s conclusion. I personally 
do believe that I learn better when I am reading content in text form, but for 
me that stems from an ability to better tune out distractions when I’m reading, 
not an inherent better absorption of the content itself. I have found that I, 
and my peers, are fully capable of learning readily from any avenue, given there 
are no distractions present. It’s hard to learn when distracted no matter what 
your style is, and I really think that’s what matters far more than the method 
of teaching.
