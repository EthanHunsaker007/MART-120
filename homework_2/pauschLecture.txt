Randy Pausch’s last lecture was a very impactful speech. The concept alone, of a 
man who knows he doesn’t have long to live and is attempting to put the feelings 
that elicits into words is a powerful one, and Randy is an excellent orator to 
boot. I related to him when he spoke about his family, and how fondly he 
remembers them. His zero gravity dream was silly; I’ve heard of the vomit comet 
and it was cool to hear about the lengths he went to ride it. I think he had a 
very good point talking about some of his more egregious dreams, too, when he 
discussed how some childhood dreams—like being captain Kirk—maybe aren’t as 
possible as kid you would have hoped. I found it relatable too when he talked 
about how he became a professor and that helped him enable the dreams of his 
students. I have always wanted to some day end up as a college professor for the 
same reason. One of my personal dreams is to leave a mark on the world in the 
form of the people I affect over my life, and have always agreed with Pausch 
that being a professor is an excellent way to achieve that goal. Something I 
liked about his lessons learned section at the end is that most of the lessons 
had a person in his life to accompany them, who either guided him to that lesson 
or laid it before him plainly. Overall this was a great speech from a great 
professor, and It left me wondering about how I am gonna spend all the time I 
have left; what dreams do I actually want to pursue?
